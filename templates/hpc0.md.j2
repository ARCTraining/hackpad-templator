For Windows users please consult our documentation page and video at https://arcdocs.leeds.ac.uk/getting_started/logon.html#connecting-from-windows 

You are required to download the software tool MobaXTerm for this workshop.

**And you're all set for HPC0!üéâ**



### For Mac/Linux Users:

**MacOS and Linux users do not need MobaXTerm** but can use your builtin Terminal application. You should follow the steps outlined in the bitesize video titled [‚ÄúConnecting to ARC off-campus via Linux/MacOS‚Äù](https://arc.leeds.ac.uk/help/videos/) and read carefully the [documentation section](https://arcdocs.leeds.ac.uk/getting_started/logon.html#connecting-from-linux-macos-systems) on connecting from Linux and MacOS, especially the section about configuring SSH for off-campus connections.

Please attempt to read the documentation and watch the videos carefully and attempt the setup steps. If you have any problems don‚Äôt worry we will spend the start of the workshop making sure everyone is connected.

In order to connect to ARC when you're off campus you'll need to do some extra configuration so that your SSH connection goes via our `remote-access` server. The following steps outline how to setup this configuration:

1. Open a Terminal on your Linux/macOS machine
2. Create a directory called `.ssh` in your home directory (if one doesn't already exist)

    ```bash
    $ mkdir ~/.ssh
    ```

3. Then open a text editor of your choice and create a file called `config` in your `.ssh` directory

    ```bash
    # for instance use the simple nano text editor
    $ nano ~/.ssh/config
    ```

4. Within this file include the following contents where `USERNAME` is replaced by your university username

    ```bash
    Host *.leeds.ac.uk !remote-access.leeds.ac.uk
    ProxyJump USERNAME@remote-access.leeds.ac.uk
    User USERNAME
    ```

5. Save this file and your configuration is all set up!

## What's your name and where do you come from?
