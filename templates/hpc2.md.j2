## Pre workshop prep

This course requires users to have ARC4 accounts and to be familiar with how to log on and connect to HPC systems.

### Required setup steps

- Users register for HPC accounts using the [HPC account request form](https://leeds.service-now.com/it?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=4c002dd70f235f00a82247ece1050ebc)
- Set up personal computer for connecting to HPC (HPC account required)
    - An overview can be found [here (including screenshots)](https://hackmd.io/xBKb6Az3QmewUsVF3ab2qg#Pre-workshop-prep)
    - For Windows, downloading MobaXTerm and configuring a session with ssh Gateway settings
    - For MacOS/Linux, creating a `~/.ssh/config` file with ProxyJump rule to `remote-access.leeds.ac.uk`

**You are expected to have experience of connecting to ARC4 before this tutorial, as no time will be made available for walking through connecting to HPC**
